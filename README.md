## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The code should run on Jupyter Notebook using Python versions 3.*. The used libraeies includes Numpy, pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, keras, seaborn and matplotlib.   

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Climate change is a global revelant urgant issue that might change our daily life in the short future. Green House Gas(GHG) emission is one of the most important impacts that needs to be mitigated. According to a report issued by the International Energy Agency(IEA), the lifecycle of buildings from construction to demolition were responsible for 37% of global energy emmisions in 2020. Find the more energy comsumption buildings to save energy is an efficent way to help with reduce GHG emission and cost saving. The energy usage for the building and the given year, measured as Site Energy Usage Intensity(Site EUI). Accurate prediction of Site EUI can help policymakers to target the buildings that might maximizie the emission reductions to retrofit them.

In this project, I was interested in knowing what are the cruicial impacts factor for energy comsumption of a building and use this information to predict an accurate Site EUI for each building. The Data is from the WiDS Datathon 2022

1. How the building class (commercial or private property) influence the EUI?
2. Do those older buildings waste more energy?
3. Does the building in the cool area or hot area that cause more energy comsumption? 
4. 
5. What factors are the cruicial impact factors for the energy comsumption of a building(given the top 10)?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).
